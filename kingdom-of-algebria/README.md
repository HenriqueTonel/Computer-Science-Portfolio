# Kingdom of Algebria

### 🚀 Welcome!
Reino de Algebria (Kingdom of Algebria) is an RPG / medieval fantasy themed math game developed by a team of Computer Science undergraduate students at Unijuí, having Henrique Kitzmann Tonel as the developer, Diovana dos Santos Manica as the designer and Gabriel Ribeiro da Rosa and Matheus Pereira Stroher as the team responsible for the documentation of all of the steps, from ideation and development to the implementation of the project.

### 🧬 About the structure
Due to the way the code was structured, this game serves as a framework for teaching any school subjects, requiring little changes in the questions and answers arrays to fit a different subject.

### 🎯 Purpose
This game was developed with the intention of use in schools in the city of Ijuí and abroad, with the purpose of serving as a tool to help students in elementary school to better understand complex math concepts that are hard to visualize during the teaching process.

The main principle involved with the development of this project is the belief that having a great math and logical structure since younger ages greatly benefits the thinking process when the indivual becomes a teenager and, eventually, an adult, facilitating the learning of new concepts while building stronger problem-solving skills. Therefore, the present game serves as a tool to make that process even more EFFECTIVE and ENJOYABLE.
